# NCL-Spring-2024-Challenges-01
NCL Spring 2024 Games : The Individual Game will test your skills with in all 9 competencies. The Individual Game is where individuals compete on their own, without the assistance of others, to solve game challenges.
NCL Competition is held twice a year at https://cyberskyline.com/ where competitors compete against each for the first spot in a game of cybersecurity. Competitors compete in various challenges : (OSINT, Cryptography, Password Cracking, Log Analysis, Network Traffic Analysis, Forensics, Scanning & Reconnaissance, Web Application Exploitation, and Enumeration & Exploitation). There's an invididual game where competitors compete on their own without the assistance of others, to solve game challenges. I participated in the games which started on 4/5/2024 at 10:00 am Pacific Time and continued until 4/7/2024 at 6:00 pm. Although, time was of an essence, the pressure was on to get as many challenges, I documented the challenges that I completed at every step of the process.
